Controls are displayed in-game.

This game is written 100% in C and tested on Linux. The windows version is cross-compiled with mingw.

All assets and non-library code was written by me.


I tried to keep everything deliberately simple; so no textures or audio. All graphics are hardcoded in C.
Audio also would have caused problems with the cross-compiler.
