This game is written 100% in C and tested on Linux. The windows version is cross-compiled with mingw.

All assets and non-library code was written by me.


I tried to keep everything deliberately simple; so no textures or audio. Audio in particular would have
been very annoying to try to get to work with the cross-compiler.
